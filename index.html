		<p>Welcome to the website for the proposed "interacting with radar
		data using open source tools" for the 2014 European Radar Conference.
		At the moment this page is mainly a place holder, we will be populating
		it as we build content. If you have any questions please contact the organizing
		committee for the course. </p>

	<h2>Course Synopsis</h2>
		<p class="timestamp">19 Dec, 2013 | Category: <a href="#">General</a> | Author: <a href="#">Scott</a></p>
		<p>Open source community based software is gaining traction in many fields.
		Packages such as Scientific Python, aided by collaborative coding paradigms
		like GitHub, allow multi-institution multi-agency groups to create naturally
		evolving software projects. The course has two main objectives: It will
		introduce the participants to community software packages designed for radar
		data processing, and it will endow participants with the basics of how to
		contribute to community software. </p>
	<h3>Course structure and methodology</h3>
		<p>The course will be interactive and “hands-on” like a tutorial.
		Participants will be introduced to different version control systems
		(e.g. git, mercurial) and to online code sharing platforms such as GitHub
		(http://github.com) or Bitbucket (http://bitbucket.org). They will gain skills
		such as “forking” a repository, making, checking in and committing changes and
		submitting “pull requests”. This will enable participants to not only use
		community software but to actively contribute to community code.<br>
		The following sessions will be task-based, and will primarily use two Python-based
		radar toolkits: wradlib (http://wradlib.bitbucket.org/)
		and Py-ART (http://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/)
		with several other packages including BALTRAD. Covered aspects might include:<br>
		●	reading polarimetric radial data and plotting and
		interrogating a single ray,<br>
		●	plotting constant elevation (PPI) data,<br>
		●	polarimetric phase processing including rainfall estimation, <br>
		●	mapping and compositing to a cartesian grid,<br>
		●	gauge adjustment, <br>
		●	volume macrophysical statistics.<br>
		For the exercises, participants will use the iPython Notebook
		(http://ipython.org). The course organisers will make sure in
		time that the participants will receive detailed guidance on how to
		prepare their notebooks for the exercises.</p>
		<h3>Target audience and prerequisite knowledge</h3>
		<p>This course is aimed at scientists who are interested in exploring new tools
		for interacting with scanning radar data. Limited knowledge or familiarity
		 with Python is useful, but not required.  </p>
		 <h3>Expected outcomes </h3>
		<p>After completing the course, attendees can expect to have a set of open source,
		 community software recipes to complete everyday radar processing tasks. This
		 course will not turn attendees into Python gurus but will help those who wish
		  to take the first step into the world of open source community software.
		  The course will be very “problem based” and participants will be encouraged
		  to bring with them examples from their research which the workshop leaders
		  will endeavor to use  during the course.</p>
